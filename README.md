It's Oct 5, 2018, Friday evening. I begin to make some projects to ensure I have something to talk about in future job hunting.

I know how to achive digits recognition using Tensorflow on python. However, for real application, you got to make it work on your hand phone, with camera scan the digits on a paper and it can be recognized on your android phone.
### color transformation
color transformation to make photo look like old or artistic, e.g. [projects here](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/OpenCV-Computer-Vision-Projects-with-Python).
### face detection
Refer to [ageitgey's face recognition project](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition). For tensorflow-based face detection tutorial, please refer to [tensorflow/model](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/running_pets.md).
### counting the numbers of people in a given pictures
