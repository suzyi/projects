# projects
It's Oct 5, 2018, Friday evening. I begin to make some projects to ensure I have something to talk about in future job hunting.
### Hand-writting digits recognition
I know how to achive digits recognition using Tensorflow on python. However, for real application, you got to make it work on your hand phone, with camera scan the digits on a paper and it can be recognized on your android phone.
### color transformation
color transformation to make photo look like old or artistic, e.g. [projects here](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/OpenCV-Computer-Vision-Projects-with-Python).
### face detection
Refer to [ageitgey's face recognition project](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition). For tensorflow-based face detection tutorial, please refer to [tensorflow/model](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/running_pets.md). and [tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection).
+ [intro](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2018/03/google-tensorflow-object-detection-api-the-easiest-way-implement-image-recognition.html) to tensorflow's object detection API, and the author's [video-based object detection](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2018/03/google-tensorflow-object-detection-api-the-easiest-way-implement-image-recognition.html)

### counting the numbers of people in a given pictures
Refer to [Xiongfeng's ICML-2017 paper]
### Play Breakout games
